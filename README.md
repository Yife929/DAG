Coding Assessment

Suggestions and Improvements
•	      Use meaningful variable names: In the original code, the variable names from and to in the Edge class are not very descriptive. I've renamed them to fromVertex and toVertex to make it clear what they represent.
•	      Use a Map to store the longest paths: To avoid recalculating the longest path from a vertex, I've introduced a Map called longestPaths that stores the longest path from each vertex. This optimization reduces the computational complexity of the solution.
•	      Use recursion with memoization: The longestPathFromVertex method uses recursion to explore the graph, and memoization (storing the results in the longestPaths map) to avoid recalculating the longest path from a vertex.
•	      Handle null input: I've added a null check in the longestPathFromVertex method to handle the case where the start vertex is null.
•	      Use a more efficient data structure: In the original code, the Vertex class has a list of outgoing edges. I've replaced this with a List<Edge> to make it clear that it's a list of edges. However, if the graph is very large, using a more efficient data structure like a HashSet<Edge> or a Graph library might be beneficial.

1.       Does the solution work for larger graphs?
	     • The solution should work for larger graphs, but its performance may degrade due to the recursive nature of the algorithm. To improve performance, you could consider using an iterative approach or a more efficient algorithm like topological sorting.
2.       Can you think of any optimizations? 
	     • One optimization could be to use a more efficient data structure, as mentioned earlier. Another optimization could be to use a more efficient algorithm, such as topological sorting, which has a linear time complexity.
3.       What's the computational complexity of your solution?
	     • The computational complexity of the solution is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This is because we visit each vertex and edge at most once during the recursive exploration of the graph.
4.       Are there any unusual cases that aren't handled?
	     • One unusual case that isn't handled is a graph with cycles. Since the problem statement specifies that the graph is a DAG, this case is not considered. However, if the graph can have cycles, the solution would need to be modified to handle them correctly.
